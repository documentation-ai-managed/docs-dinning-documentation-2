## Structuring Pages and Sections

Organize your documentation hierarchically. Create top-level sections and nest pages underneath for intuitive navigation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Section" icon="folder">
    Navigate to your workspace dashboard.

    Click `New Section` and enter a title like `API Reference`.

    Save to generate a folder-like structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-text">
    Inside the section, select `New Page`.

    Choose `guide.mdx` as the file type for rich content.

    Start editing with the built-in MDX editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder Content" icon="move">
    Drag pages in the sidebar to reorder.

    Use `Promote` or `Demote` buttons for nesting levels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Maintain a clear hierarchy: Use H2 for main sections and H3 for subsections to improve readability.
</Callout>

## Adding Multimedia and Embeds

Enhance your docs with images, videos, and code snippets. The platform supports native MDX components for seamless integration.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Images" icon="image">
    Upload assets to your workspace media library.

    Use the `<Image>` component:

````jsx
<Image
  src="https://your-workspace.com/assets/screenshot.png"
  alt="Dashboard overview"
  width="800"
  height="600"
/>
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Videos" icon="video">
    Embed platform videos or external sources.

    Example for self-hosted video:

````jsx
<Video
  src="https://your-workspace.com/videos/tutorial.mp4"
  title="Setup tutorial"
  width="560"
  height="315"
  controls="true"
/>
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Examples" icon="code">
    Highlight syntax with code blocks.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
async function fetchData(apiKey) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  });
  return response.json();
}
```
```python
import requests

def fetch_data(api_key):
    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.example.com/users',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    )
    return response.json()
```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Control Basics

Track changes automatically. Every edit creates a new version, allowing you to revert or compare history.

<Expandable title="View Version History" default-open="true">
  Right-click a page in the sidebar and select `Version History`.

  Compare diffs side-by-side.

  Restore any previous version with one click.
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="alert">
  Commit meaningful changes with descriptions like `Fix API endpoint docs` to aid team reviews.
</Callout>

## Collaboration Workflows

Invite team members and assign roles. Use comments, approvals, and real-time editing for smooth teamwork.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as You
    participant B as Teammate
    participant C as Platform

    A->>C: Edit Page
    C->>B: Notify Change
    B->>C: Add Comment
    A->>C: Resolve & Publish
    Note over A,B: Real-time sync
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Collaborators" icon="user-plus">
    Go to workspace settings.

    Add emails and set permissions: `Editor`, `Viewer`, or `Admin`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes" icon="eye">
    Use `@mentions` in comments for quick feedback.

    Approve publishes via pull request-like workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>
